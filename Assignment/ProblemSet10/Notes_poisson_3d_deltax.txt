Failure on poisson_3d_deltax.cu:

About your question, I am not sure I understand it exactly. 
Do you mean to change the lattice spacing ?  
Note that in numerical analysis, any quantity is expressed 
in term of a dimensionless number. For the momentum, 
k*a is always restricted to a interval of 2 \pi, 
i.e.,  [0, 2\pi), or [-\pi, \pi), etc. You can make k*a finer
by going to a larger lattice size (i.e., with more sites in each 
direction). In other words, you cannot change the lattice spacing 
by hand in your computation.
